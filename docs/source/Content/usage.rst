How can YOU use RADAR4KIT as data provider
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The administrator can set up separate workspaces (like **IMK-TRO**) for different user groups (e.g. research groups, projects, institutes). Subsequently, the administrator can designate other users as so called curators. While the administrators are in general represented by the "RDM service team" at KIT, the curators are usually data managers within the user groups of the workspaces.

The curators can upload, edit, archive and, if necessary, publish research data in the workspaces designated for them by the administrator. Curators can in turn authorize other users registered with RADAR4KIT as subcurators for their workspace. Subcurators are also data providers, but do not have the ability to archive or publish data packages or to designate other users as subcurators. Subcurators are in general researchers or other data providers within the user groups of the workspace.

What does that mean in practice?
================================

In practice that means, if you want to publish data at RADAR4KIT, go to the webpage `www.radar.kit.edu <https://radar.kit.edu>`_ and press the login button. Choose KIT from the "List of Institutions" and go on with the well known shibboleth login by using your KIT account. In the next step write an email to the curator of your workspace (institute) and ask for authorization as subcurator at RADAR4KIT. The curators are

They will add you as subcurator. You need to relog into RADAR4KIT to be able to create a data package in your workspace.
